# Developer Tool Landing Page – UI Recreation Project

## Overview

This project is a static, desktop-optimized recreation of a modern developer tooling website interface. It was developed as part of a frontend assignment to demonstrate strong fundamentals in layout design, semantic HTML, and pure CSS styling.

The primary objective was to accurately replicate the visual structure, spacing, typography, and overall design system while strictly following the constraints provided in the assignment brief.

## Project Objective

This exercise focused on:

* Converting a real-world website into clean static code
* Practicing layout structuring using Flexbox and Grid
* Improving spacing, typography, and alignment accuracy
* Writing semantic and maintainable HTML
* Building without frameworks or scripting

The emphasis is on visual precision rather than interactivity.

## Page Composition

The following UI sections were recreated:

1. Navigation header
2. Hero section
3. Partner or brand logos
4. Feature highlight blocks
5. Product capability cards
6. Testimonials
7. Use case stories
8. Changelog or updates section
9. Team or about section
10. Call-to-action banner
11. Multi-column footer

Each section was designed with consistent spacing, hierarchy, and alignment for desktop screens.
