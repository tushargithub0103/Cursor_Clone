# 💻 Developer Tool Landing Page — UI Recreation Project

This project is a static, desktop-optimized recreation of a modern developer tooling website interface. It was developed as part of a frontend assignment to demonstrate strong fundamentals in layout design, semantic HTML, and pure CSS styling.

The focus was on accurately reproducing the visual composition, spacing system, and overall design language while strictly adhering to the constraints provided in the brief.

## 🎯 Project Objective

The goal of this exercise was to:

- Translate an existing production website into clean static code
- Practice layout structuring using Flexbox and Grid
- Strengthen attention to spacing, typography, and alignment
- Replicate design precision without relying on JavaScript or frameworks

This assignment emphasizes **visual fidelity and code simplicity over interactivity**.

## ✅ Implementation Guidelines Followed

The project strictly complies with the assignment constraints:

- Desktop-first design approach
- Pure HTML & CSS implementation
- No JavaScript usage
- No CSS frameworks (Tailwind, Bootstrap, etc.)
- No animations or transitions
- Static layout only
- Emphasis on clean structure and styling accuracy

## 📐 Page Composition

The following UI blocks were recreated to mirror the original structure:

1. Navigation Header
2. Hero / Introduction Section
3. Brand & Partner Logos
4. Feature Highlights
5. Product Capability Cards
6. Testimonials / Reviews
7. Use Case Examples
8. Update / Changelog Area
9. Team Information Section
10. Call-to-Action Banner
11. Multi-column Footer

Each section was built with consistent spacing, hierarchy, and responsive alignment for desktop screens.

## 🎨 Design System

### Typography

- System fonts: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif
- Minimal and readable type for a clean developer-focused aesthetic

### Color Scheme

| Element        | Hex Value |
| -------------- | --------- |
| Background     | #14120b   |
| Cards / Panels | #1b1913   |
| Primary Text   | #ffffff   |
| Secondary Text | #949390   |
| Accent         | orangered |

The palette maintains a dark, high-contrast interface to align with modern developer tooling products.
